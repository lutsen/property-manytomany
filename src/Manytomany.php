/**
 * Controller for the Lagan many-to-many property.
 * Lets the user define a many-to-many relation between two content entries.
 * The Manytomany property type controller enables a many-to-many relation between 2 Lagan models.
 * The name of the property should be the name of the Lagan model this model can have a many-to-many
 * relation with. For this to work properly the other model should have a many-to-many relation with this model as well.
 * So in our example in the Lagan project the Lagan Hoverkraft model has a many-to-many relation
 * with the Lagan Feature model, and the Lagan Feature model has a many-to-many relation with the Lagan Hoverkraft model.
 *
 * A property type controller can contain a set, read, delete and options method. All methods are optional.
 * To be used with Lagan: https://github.com/lutsen/lagan
