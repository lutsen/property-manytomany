Lagan Many-to-many Property Controller
======================================

Controller for the Lagan many-to-many property.  
Lets the user define a many-to-many relation between two content entries.

The Manytomany property type controller enables a many-to-many relation between 2 Lagan entries. The name of the property should be the name of the Lagan model this model can have a many-to-many relation with. For this to work properly the other model should have a many-to-many relation with this model as well. So in our example in the Lagan project the Lagan Hoverkraft model has a many-to-many relation with the Lagan Feature model, and the Lagan Feature model has a many-to-many relation with the Lagan Hoverkraft model.

To be used with [Lagan](https://github.com/lutsen/lagan). Lagan lets you create flexible content objects with a simple class, and manage them with a web interface.

Lagan is a project of [LÃºtsen Stellingwerff](http://lutsen.land/) from [HoverKraft](http://www.hoverkraft.nl/).
